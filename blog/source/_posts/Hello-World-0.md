# Hello World


This blog should encompass some of the things I do everyday that I feel aren't documented very well out there. That's very true when it comes to bleeding edge frameworks like **Bot Framework**.  As well as some other ones I'm forgetting.

I would like to focus on making some daily posts as well, on codepen I guess. That I can keep myself in check on, and force myself to complete. Most daily pens are usually like,  _Daily UI #21_.  

I mean it's cool making some cool UI, but everyday?   Yea I'd consider doing this. Get my brain wrapped around SCSS/less. I also have ambitious ideas, that are hard to pull off in a day. Maybe a couple days but that doesn't really count as daily then, right? I'm not really sure what the rulebook is for the these kinds of excersizes.

Well, the reason I bring up, the dailies. There's a ton of templates out there, you can find them on yeoman, for example. However, I started my journey with C#. Now, it's been almost 2 years and I can safely say that I much prefer javascript even if it's in a pain in the !@#. C# offers some great things, but at this point in time, I see why javascript was ridiculed before, and beloved today. The introduction to TypeScript gives us errors before build time, which is great. I've worked on so many things without a debugger present I had to create a debug workflow for the application. It's such a headache. Then there's angular 1. Which as much as I love angular, I cannot stand the compile time errors I see in my console window, which have terrible explanations. Don't get me wrong they were cool at first. I click on it, get my specefic variable in the mix, on their page. I felt touched. Like Angular was going to hold my hand for a second. Until I read the possible fix.

    it('should work', function () {
         return db.find({ type: 'Sucka' }).should.eventually.be.smart(false);
    })

Yea very helpful.  All joking aside, Angular is a very awesome MVVM framework that I adore. It's just the docs are about as helpful as having cereal and no milk. Eventually I realize what was inside the mocha test, that I was able to Google that, and find out I can use it in-line in html, converting a json request to straight html instantly i.e. `ng-html-bind`. Which is still super cool to me. You can also easily make a theme switcher that will swap css files in your DOM effortlessly without loading. Which is probably 10x cooler, but hey, I'm a simple dude.

Like I said, coming from C#, where I didn't know programming that well, especially OOP, but I knew software, Visual Studio is **powerful**. For me to create SQL Tables inside a view with a controller and a model, with Entity Framework, then render it with some razor (.cshtml), just like that? Crazy. Albeit, took me some time but if that isn't cool then, I don't know man you're just in denial. Considering I barely wrote any code.

So MVC Web App's come with a template that has register in it already, with a template SQL db.

# So It doesn't have everything but jeez, that's crazy for a template... Or is it?

Well lets look at javascript, the edgy language, that no one wants to adopt but everyone writes in some way shape or form.
If I want to create a template in angular 1, I load up yeoman. `yo angular`. Cool already off the bat we have folder structure, pretty much everything you see here (batteries not included). So what functionality does it have with about 12 folders, each one containing roughly 3 files, and then 8 app files  ( grunt, package.json, etc )? Well...

# Yea there's really not much going on here that strikes me as :O


Anyway my rants coming to a close as I just want to say, I think daily UI's will be a great thing to do for awhile. I can try creating a angular 1 MVC template with registration, possibly a bash script that generates a mongodb server, with proper Login/Registration fields. That might take longer than a day, but I welcome anyones help on the matter. I miss the MVC templates ya dig?
